SUMMARY OF RESULTS:

Summarize your results on the provided examples.
> Both functions work on the chair test-case.
> Uncompress works given the example.
> Compress still has trouble finding stuff...

Were you able to construct a perfect hash function?
If not, how close did you get (how many collisions)?
If yes, describe the smallest perfect hash you were able to construct.
> Yes, not very small, but not too bad. Run ~$ make test

What was your compression ratio?
> Build debug -> make test

Did you make any additional test cases?
> Not yet.

Describe your non-greedy search strategy:
